# About

An attempt at getting a vue-cli library (TypeScript) that wraps vuetify components.

## mylib (TypeScript)

The library project.

## myapp (TypeScript)

A normal vue-cli app that uses the mylib.

# Errors

The current error I'm getting is when I type into the text field it says it's modifying $attrs, $listeners, and mutating props.

![Error](error.png?raw=true "Error")
